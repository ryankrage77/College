# <p align="center">Introduction</p>
My client owns a small company, with several employees on a zero-hour contract. He is currently tracking each employee’s salary in a spreadsheet, but this is cumbersome and unprofessional. He would prefer to have a bespoke application to more easily manage each employee’s salary.
