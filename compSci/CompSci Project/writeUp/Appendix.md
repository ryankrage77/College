### 1.2: Relative file paths
A relative file path is used when there is no access to higher directories, only lower ones. Most file paths start at the root directory, i.e C:/ on windows or / on Linux and Unix.  
As my program is designed to be run on any windows computer in any location, it cannot use the install location to get the file paths of the program resources, such as the help document.
