<h1><p align="center">Design</p></h1>
<h3>Setting &amp; completing tasks</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of the application is to calculate pay for each employee, so first there must be a way to represent and store information about employees.<br>
Using OOP (object-orientated programming), each employee could be an instance of a class (created when the user adds a new employee), with tasks as properties of the employee class.<br>
This solution would require the user to re-enter all of the employees information and tasks each time, so it would be even less useful than the spreadsheet my client is currently using.<br>
A better solution would be to create a file to store information about each employee. This could be a simple text file, with the name of each task (and whether or not it is completed) on each line.<br>
This solution also allows the program to save the data, satisfying two requirements in one.<br>
Assuming that different tasks have different pay, this will also be saved in the file.<br>
Each line could have the format of <code>taskName;pay;completed</code>.</p>
<h3>Calculating pay</h3>
<p>The calculation is very simple, number of tasks completed * pay per task.<br>
There will need to be a setting for the pay per task. As different tasks may be worth different amounts, the pay will be set when the task is created.</p>
<h3>Saving data</h3>
<p>I have already outlined how data for tasks will be saved (in a text file), however it may be necessary to save other data about employees, such as contact details. This could be incorporated into the employees file. A set number of lines can be dedicated to each section (e.g; first 5 lines for employee information, then line 6 onwards for tasks).</p>
<h3>Exporting data</h3>
<p>A huge part of exporting has been solved already - the information will be saved in separate text files. This means exporting is a relatively simple matter of formatting the data for different purposes.<br>
It would be best to export to .XML, as this format can be used a variety of spreadsheet programs such as Excel, Calc and Google Sheets. Depending on the complexity of this format, more research is needed to determine if this is within the scope of this project. If it is not, then the data could be formatted for easy reading in .txt format.</p>
<h3>Aesthetics</h3>
<p>While I have more experience with making console applications, it would be much easier for the user if I created a windows form application instead. My first draft of the design is below;<br>

On the left, there is a scrollable list of employees. The user can add, remove or edit employees through the ‘Edit’ menu at the top.<br>
In the middle is a section to show information about the employees. There will also be an option to add a picture, to make it easier to identify which employee is currently selected at a glance.<br>
On the right is a list of tasks for the currently selected employee. Here, the user can add and remove tasks, as well as editing details such as the description, when it should be completed by, whether or not it has been completed, and how much it is worth.</p>
<h4>Making a GUI</h4>
<p>By looking at some tutorials for making Windows Forms (which I determined was the easiest way to make a GUI with C#), I have outlined some ideas for how to make GUI;</p>
<h5>The employee list</h5>
<p>This could be a ListView, a winform element that can display a list of items. These items can have sub-items, which could be used to store information about the employee, and tasks.</p>
<h5>The employee details</h5>
<p>These could be shown using labels, which are basically just text that can be programmatically updated.<br>
The image could be shown using an imageBox, a winform element for displaying images. It can automatically resize them, so limiting the user to a particular resolution isn’t required. Limiting filetypes for this image might be.</p>
<h5>The task list</h5>
<p>This will probably be another ListView, but it’s contents will be taken from the subitems of the first. It can be programmatically updated whenever an employee is selected.</p>
<h5>Titles, menus, etc</h5>
<p>There is a standard menu element for winforms, and titles can simply be labels.</p>
<h3>Help section/manual</h3>
<p>To ensure the client can use the software without assistance, I will include a manual that can be opened from within the application, probably in the form of a web page.</p>
<h3>Install/portability</h3>
<p>The program will not require installation, but as it requires resources (such as employee data and the help section), I will need to use relative filepaths to locate these resources. See Appendix 1.2 for more on Relative filepaths.</p>
<h3>Validation</h3>
<p>As this software will be event-driven, it is important to ensure the user’s input is correctly validated to avoid exceptions and other errors. The easiest way to do this is remove the need for validation - this can be done to any inputs that are not actually processed, such as employee details. As the data is not used by the program, the user can enter anything they like.<br>
Next, is to limit what the user is able to enter. This can be achieved using masks, which will stop invalid input from appearing in the input box. For example, if a text box requires a number, the mask will stop anything other than integers appearing in the input box.<br>
Lastly, is checking the input to see if it meets the criteria. One place this may be need is for editing employees and their tasks - an employee cannot be edited if none exist, and a task cannot be created if there is no employee to assign it to. This means the program will need check there is actually something to edit when the user clicks the edit button.</p>
<h3>Flowchart</h3>
<p>This is a flow chart I created to show how the program will work. As the program is event-driven, it does not translate well to flowchart format, but will still help in designing the program.</p>
