<h1><p align="center">Introduction</p></h1>
<p>My client owns a small company, with several employees on a zero-hour contract. He is currently tracking each employee’s salary in a spreadsheet, but this is cumbersome and unprofessional. He would prefer to have a bespoke application to more easily manage each employee’s salary.</p>
