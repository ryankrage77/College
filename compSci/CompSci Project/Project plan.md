# Introduction
- [x] Scope, boundaries
- [x] I/O
- [x] Sufficient complexity
- [x] Disclaimer (it's only a project! No warranty or guarantees)

# Analysis
- [x] Outline clients situation & basic need (small company, zero-hour contract, employee pay tracker)
- [x] Record interview & transcribe
- [x] Come up with a set of features & functions based on interview
- [ ] extrapolate more features/functions from generic software (basic obvious stuff)
- [x] explain why using GUI rather than command line
- [x] Scope
- [ ] â€‹Confirm scope/boundaries with client
- [ ] <s>ER diagram</s>
- [ ] IOPS chart
- [ ] Use-case diagram
- [ ] SMART objectives

# Design
- [ ] explain how each function/feature will be implemented, including:
  - [x] adding & removing employees
  - [x] editing employee data
  - [x] adding & removing tasks
  - [x] editing tasks
  - [x] viewing information
  - [x] saving
  - [ ] exporting
  - [x] HTML help document
  - [x] relative filepaths & portability
- [ ] Flow chart for all code (including subroutines)

# Technical solution
- [x] code
- [ ] use Evernote documentation to show where solution deviated from design

# Testing
- [x] Come up with test strategy
- [x] test EVERY function & feature, including pay calculation and help feature (80% done)
- [x] explain lack of verification

# Evaluation
- [x] copy old version, add in notes from Lez and OneNote
- [x] add more detail to lengthen
- [ ] User Acceptance Testing (feedback)
- [ ] How the changes were agreed upon (more IM)
- [ ] Change reasons for not implementing features (time constraints in order to meet deadline, was within scope but takes too much resources & not critical. (i.e: optimisation to the satisfaction of the client))
- [ ] Did the project pass or fail? (Specific Measurable Achievable Relevant Time-bound objectives)

# Other
- [x] Appendix ('refer to Appendix x.x')
- [ ] informal/formal testing
- [ ] Minimum length of 25-ish pages (-code)
- [ ] see picture of board (write up!)

# TO DO
- [x] Add introduction - move outline, sufficient complexity & disclaimer to intro, move IO to analysis
- [ ] Convert MD to .docx (save preview as HTML & C/P into Word)
- [ ] Add cover page & page numbers
