# Introduction
- [ ] Scope, boundaries (I/O)
- [ ] Sufficient complexity
- [ ] Disclaimer (it's only a project! No warranty or guarantees)

# Analysis
- [ ] Outline clients situation & basic need (small company, zero-hour contract, employee pay tracker)
- [ ] Record interview & transcribe
- [ ] Come up with a set of features & functions based on interview
- [ ] extrapolate more features/functions from generic software (basic obvious stuff)
- [ ] explain why using GUI rather than command line
- [ ] ER diagram
- [ ] â€‹Confirm scope/boundaries with client
- [ ] IOPS chart

# Design
- [ ] explain how each function/feature will be implemented, including:
  - [ ] adding & removing employees
  - [ ] editing employee data
  - [ ] adding & removing tasks
  - [ ] editing tasks
  - [ ] viewing information
  - [ ] saving
  - [ ] exporting
  - [ ] HTML help document
  - [ ] relative filepaths & portability
- [ ] Flow chart for all code (including subroutines)

# Technical solution
- [ ] code
- [ ] use Evernote documentation to show where solution deviated from design

# Testing
- [ ] Come up with test strategy
- [ ] test EVERY function & feature, including pay calculation and help feature
- [ ] explain lack of verification
- [ ] or add retrospectively by converting to DateTime variable

# Evaluation
- [ ] copy old version, add in notes from Lez and OneNote
- [ ] add more detail to lengthen
- [ ] User Acceptance Testing (feedback)
- [ ] Did the project pass or fail? (SMART objectives)

# Other
- [ ] Appendix ('refer to x')
- [ ] informal/formal testing
- [ ] Minimum length of 25 pages (-code)
- [ ] see picture of board (write up!)
