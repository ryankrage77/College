##Section A

1.1) 123 in binary:  
0111101

1.2) How many different denary numbers can be represented using 8-bit binary?
127 (one less than the MSB)

1.3) 123 in hex:  
7B

1.4) Why are bit patterns displayed using hex instead of binary?  
Because it is shorter, hex takes up less room and is quicker to read.

2.5-8) ???

3.9) What is resolution in a bitmap?  
The width and height of the image in pixels.

3.10) What is colour depth?  
How mnay bits are used to store the colour values of each pixel.

3.11) An image is 10 * 10 pixels and has 16 colours. Calculate its size in bytes:  
16 colours = 4 bits. 10 * 10 = 100. 100 * 4 = 400 bits. 400 bits = 50 bytes.

3.12) State on advantage of vector graphics over bitmap graphics:  
Vector graphics have smaller file sizes.

4.13) what phase of the development lifecycle is (a)?  
Design

4.14) What phase is (b)?  
Testing

5.15) Describe the goalof this problem:  
To obtain exactly one litre of water.

5.16) Two jugs, one 5 litres and one 3 litres. Both are unmarked. One tap. One drain. Unlimited
water.

5.17) ???
