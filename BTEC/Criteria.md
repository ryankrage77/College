6.1
P1
- correct definitions in
- use of procedural programming (procedural (predates OOP, used extensively, still used) and event-driven (GUI))
- limitations (procedural - not ideal for extensive code reuse, ecapsulation, implementing OOP features. Event-driven is for user interfaces, relies heavily on user interaction)
P2
- organisational policy is optimised for efficiency, so IDEs and languages will be chosen for this reason. may use openj soutrce for idealogy. Consistency.
- use fewer languages to make it easier to hire staff.
- suitabilty - other uses of languages, such as low-level access, data structures, etc
- reliability - talk about language design, what features they have/are designed for. C could result in catastrophic failiures, C# less so, and Ada is safety critical/realtime.
P3
- correct FOR loop definition.
- state example language (python)
- fix typo
P4
- note example language
- fix byte count for strings, specify 1 per character for char

P5
- functions *can* accept inputs and *must* return an output
- procedure *can* "			"	"    *can*  "       "
- classes/objects do not *always* represent real things
- change example of class/subclas/object
- change example - wtf was I thinking?!?!
- fix last sentence
- fix headings on life cycle diagram

6.2
M2
- change whole metres to floats
- make pseudo code more pseudo less python/java

28.1
- mention *series* of point-to-point transmissions
- mention anti-virus, expand on DDOS
- mention DPA is for end user
